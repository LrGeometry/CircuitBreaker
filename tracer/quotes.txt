Ever get that feeling of déjà vu?
Let's try that again.
Just in time!
Just in the nick of time!
The world could always use more heroes.
I have this under control.
Looks like you need a time out.
Cheers, love! The cavalry's here!
I knew I was good at this.
It’s just the strangest feeling of deja vu.
